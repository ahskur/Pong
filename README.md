# Pong
 Simple recreation of Pong using Pythons' Turtle Module


Day 22 of 100 Days of Code Challenge

This time using the turtle module included in Python I've recreated the Pong game. 
You can use 'Arrow Up' and 'Arrow Down' to move the right Paddle and 'W' and 'S' to move the left paddle.
The puck/ball gets faster the more it gets hit with the paddles.


# TODOs:
- Make a welcome screen
- Explain commands in-game
- Make a maximum ammount of points so the game can end
